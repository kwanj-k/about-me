        "description":"Andela builds distributed engineering teams with Africaâ€™s top software engineers. I took on different projects during my time at Andela. During the first three months at Andela, I worked in a team of six where we tasked with creating a blog application using Django-rest and react-redux. The main purpose of this project was to hound our skills on how to work in a distributed team, how to deliver world-class features and how to handle stakeholders in an Engineering team. I then joined Converge, a meeting room management system that manages the availability and usage of meeting rooms at Andela. Converge is meant to enable the company to get real-time insights needed to refine available space to fit the changing needs of the company. At converge we built using Graphql from the start, the backend team which I was part of uses python. During my time at converge, I worked on optimising analytics queries, assigning resources to rooms in the backend using SQLAlchemy association objects among other bug-fixes that arose during my time with the team.",
