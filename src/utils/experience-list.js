            "JamboPay is an innovative electronic payments platform that enables you to securely make and receive payments through your phone, bank, over the web and at thousands of pay points across the world. When I joined jamboPay, we were trying to come with a solution that would give insight on how the products in the company were doing in a quick glance. We formed a team of three to work on the dashboard. Two engineers work on the frontend using react-redux while am the backend and DevOps engineer. We have successfully been able to develop a real-time dashboard which reads data from the Jambopay system. Technologies used are Django rest for the backend and Dokku for deployments on a Linux server.",

			"Andela builds distributed engineering teams with Africaâ€™s top software engineers. I took on different projects during my time at Andela. During the first three months at Andela, I worked in a team of six where we tasked with creating a blog application using Django-rest and react-redux. The main purpose of this project was to hound our skills on how to work in a distributed team, how to deliver world-class features and how to handle stakeholders in an Engineering team. I then joined Converge, a meeting room management system that manages the availability and usage of meeting rooms at Andela. Converge is meant to enable the company to get real-time insights needed to refine available space to fit the changing needs of the company. At converge was built using Graphql from the start, the backend team which I was part of uses python, the frontend uses reactjs(Javascript) and mobile uses java. During my time converge, I worked on optimising analytics queries, assigning resources to rooms in the backend using SQLAlchemy association objects among other bug-fixes that arose during my time with the team",
